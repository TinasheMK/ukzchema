Hello

Yesterday I managed to check as a joining member on my phone and i can say its coming out really nice bro. Here are some changes or some observations i got or suggestions.

5. If you can make a preview before final saving as the nominees and next of keen wont be changeable and should be in read only mode after saving and can only be changed by the admin. ⚠️

10. Members nominees are not coming up properly on the admin side pane ka err like on fetching data from the db. 

But honestly chikubuda boss chinhu...i will also keep checking one or two and we hel each other zvipere izvi.


regards
