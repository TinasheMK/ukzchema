<h2>UKZ CHEMA <strong>ASSOCIATION</strong></h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>The idea of forming this project came after realising that as Zimbabweans living in the United Kingdom, we need to form a body that would work to help members with funeral costs in the event of death of nominated loved ones, whether they wish to be repatriated or laid to rest in the UK. We have experienced a lot of problems as a community where fellow Zimbabweans who have passed on in the UK spent so much time in the morgue while funds are being raised through Crowdfunding Platforms to give the deceased a decent burial. The vision of the project aims to encourage large scale transition from the humiliation of crowd funded funerals of Zimbabweans in keeping with our traditions of contributing Chema.</p>
<p>The project at hand aims to encourage social cohesion, and a desire for Zimbabweans to work together, particularly at times of bereavement. The main selling points of the project to date are a Pay As You Go nature, and the open recruitment format. By recruiting many members (targeted at 1000 contributing members), small, nominal contributions will amount to a significant amount of compassion offerings (Chema) in time of need. The association will also act as an information point in UK for our members on issues of illness and death.</p>
